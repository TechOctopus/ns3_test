# CAM Message Definitions

This directory contains the definitions for Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) used in the VANETZA-NS3 adapter.

## Overview

The CAM message definitions in this directory are used by the adapter to generate and process CAM messages according to ETSI standards.

## Implementation

Currently, this is a placeholder directory. The actual implementation uses the CAM message definitions from the Vanetza library.

To customize the CAM message format, modify the `GenerateCam()` and `ReceiveCam()` methods in `src/adapter/cam_application.cpp`.

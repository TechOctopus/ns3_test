# Utility Functions

This directory contains utility functions used by the VANETZA-NS3 adapter.

## Overview

The utility functions in this directory provide common functionality used across the adapter components.

## Implementation

Currently, this is a placeholder directory. The actual implementation uses utility functions from the NS3 and Vanetza libraries.

To add custom utility functions, create new files in this directory and include them in the appropriate components.
